     # This sections compares a filename to a regular expression, as explained by Claude Sonnet 4.6:
     #     - ^ refers to the start of a string
     #     - .*/ refers to any characters followed by a slash, so groups together anything within the 
     #       directory, basically, since it "eats" the directory path
     #     - (.*)_workflow_ captures group 1: any characters, followed by literal "_workflow_"
     #     - (.*) captures group 2: any characters
     #     - .pkl captures the literal ".pkl" - the . can represent any character, technically, but in 
     #       doing that also captures a literal .
     #        e.g. output/processed/reproducibility/sub01_workflow_batch3.pkl
     #     - .*/ consumes "~/output/processed/reproducibility/"
     #     - Group 1 task captures "sub01"
     #           - _workflow_ matches literally
     #     - Group 2 task captures "batch3"
     #           - .pkl matches literally
     #
     # When the regex match succeeds in [[ ]], bash will populate the BASH_REMATCH array, where [0] is 
     # the whole match, [1] = task 1 match ("sub01"), and [2] = task 2 match ("batch3").
     #
     # The `&&` chaining means that ONLY set the `task` and `batch` variables if the regex actually matches.
     #
     # This has the potential for a hidden hiccup, in that `task` and `batch` keep whatever values they have 
     # from the previous loop iteration, since there is no `else` clause to reset them, which could potentially 
     # silently submit a job with stale `task`/`batch` names if a filename doesn't fit the expected pattern 
     # for some reason.
     [[ $filename =~ ^.*/(.*)_workflow_(.*).pkl ]] && task=${BASH_REMATCH[1]} && batch=${BASH_REMATCH[2]}
     # This line submits a SLURM job using the 4th - 8th arguments passed to THIS script, so
     # $4 = config[nodes], $5 = config[ntasks], $6 = config[account], $7 = config[time], $8 = config[mem].
     # It then calls on the batch.sh script, providing batch.sh the data path, the output path, the batch, 
     # and the task as parameters.
